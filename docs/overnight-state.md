# Overnight state

Rewritten after **every** card lands or stops, and re-read before any card is
launched and before any merge. Its test: a completely fresh session, with none of
the conversation that produced it, could take over from this file alone.

**Last rewritten:** 2026-09-01, 22:47, by the integrator session. No card landed;
what changed is a set of founder decisions about content, folded into the cards
they affect.

---

## Right now

**No lane is running. Nothing is in flight.** The three worktrees that had been
created for lanes B, C and F (`../sortiva-b`, `-c`, `-f`) were empty — clean trees,
no commits beyond `main` — and were removed on the founder's instruction. Their
branches `night-b`, `night-c`, `night-f` still exist, all pointing at an ancestor
of `main`, and hold nothing.

`main` is at the commit recorded below. The working tree is clean.

**The founder is awake and directing.** The unattended rules in
`docs/overnight-run.md` describe how to work when they are not; while they are,
ask rather than assume.

## What is on `main`

Wave 2 has not started. The last four commits are the wave-1 close-out plus two
cards that landed on their own:

| Commit | What it was |
|---|---|
| `6fb14a5` | docs — re-ordering what remained after the sweep |
| `b0c1413` | `T-SWEEP` — removed 1,007 spec references from the code, left 15 in shipped migrations |
| `c71f023` | docs — the hard rules for unattended work |
| `f6775dd` | `T8.4a` — spend caps that pause the product before the bill arrives |

**Gate result on this tree** (from `docs/handoff-wave2.md`, each command run
separately): lint clean · 7 planted lint violations all rejected · typecheck 9
packages · **914 tests passing** · 56 API routes agreeing with the API document ·
build 9 routes · eval and chaos pass · migrations on an *empty* database produce 41
tables and 3 guard triggers.

That last row is the one worth re-checking after any schema work: a migration that
only ever runs against a database which already has the tables has not been tested.

## Where the order stands

From `docs/handoff-wave2.md` §"The order" — **none of these has started**:

1. Four lanes in parallel, none waiting on another: **`T2.1`** (lane B), **`T9.1`**
   (F), **`T3.1`** (C), **`T8.0`** (G).
2. **The operations card**, after `T2.1` and before `T2.2`. The reasoning, from
   `docs/overnight-run.md`: `T2.1` is what makes background steps actually run, so
   it is the first moment a diagnosis script can be tested against a store that is
   genuinely stuck rather than a fixture — and `T2.2` is the card most likely to
   strand one.
3. Then the dependency order, which lane B sets.

Four concurrent building sessions is the cap. Check `uptime` before launching;
five saturated this 12-core machine earlier and all five stalled at once.

## Decisions taken, and what depends on them

**Nothing here was assumed.** Both content decisions below were made by the founder
directly, in conversation on 2026-09-01. No default from
`docs/founder-decisions.md` §C has been taken, by any card, so far.

**1. Prices live in articles as a reference to the current value, never as a
number.** An article body never stores a price, stock state, sale status or product
URL as text; it stores a placeholder that is filled in from the live store at the
moment of publish or republish. The reader still sees a real figure — it is simply
always the current one.

Two things travel with it: prose may not build an *argument* on a price ("the
cheapest in the range"), because a figure rendering correctly does not make a
sentence reasoning about it true; and a price change stops triggering a refresh,
because there is nothing left to correct. The out-of-stock trigger is unchanged — a
product unavailable long enough makes the *recommendation* wrong, not just a number.

*Why it mattered enough to decide now:* the plan sells at most one article a day,
and a refresh spends that day exactly like a new article. A merchant running a sale
across a range was losing a day per affected article to fix nothing but a number.

*Depends on it:* **`T4.0`** must create the reference storage — migrations are only
added by schema-wave cards, so an article published before `T4.0` would carry
literal prices that cannot be retrofitted. Also folded into `T4.3` (writing rule),
`T5.1` (export resolves references), `T5.2` (publish-time resolution), `T5.3`
(price-drift trigger retired).

**2. A draft with nothing new to say is rejected outright, with no repair attempt.**
Of the quality criteria, information gain — does a reader get anything here they
would not get from the pages already ranking — is the one whose failure ends the run
immediately. Every other criterion keeps its single repair attempt. The reasoning:
the others fail for reasons a rewrite can fix; this one fails because the evidence
had nothing distinctive in it, and rewriting adds no material that was never
gathered.

This does **not** contradict invariant 11's "one repair loop max" — that is a
ceiling, and this criterion now sits at zero. *Depends on it:* **`T4.4`**.

Both are journalled in full in `DECISIONS.md`, titled with the card ID so the
grep the launch prompt prescribes finds them.

**Also worth knowing:** `docs/handoff-wave2.md` still lists "do the spend caps count
failed vendor calls?" as an open decision. It is no longer open — the `T8.4a` entry
in `DECISIONS.md` closed it with a documented default (they *do* count), and named
the single boolean that flips it. The handoff is stale on that one line.

## The content spec, and what to trust in it

`docs/content-spec.md` arrived from the cofounder on 2026-09-01. **It was written
against a different codebase** — every package, file, table and baseline commit it
cites is absent here, so its `[SHIPPED]` / `[BUILD]` / `[BLOCKED]` markers and its
gap register describe some other tree and must not be planned from. Three things it
calls blocking are already built or already settled here: per-query Search Console
data, the `opportunities` table, and the Shopify `read_products` permission.

Its *content* substance is good and has been extracted into
**`docs/content-pointers.md`**, which is the file to read — the claim model, the
citation rule, structure shapes with named failure conditions, the passage rules,
the banned-language inventory, the free checks that run before any paid one, the
contradiction check, and how an article is kept true after publish. The M4 and M5
cards now cite it by section.

**One piece of it is not done and needs a founder answer before it can be:** the
banned-language list is half Hungarian, because that is what it was tested against.
A list of tells does not translate — each launch locale needs its own, written by
someone who reads that language. Noted in `content-pointers.md` §6.

**One piece deliberately not folded in:** the typed refresh diagnosis — deciding
*why* an article decayed before choosing how much of it to rewrite — belongs in
`T7.2`, which is far enough out that it was left alone. `content-pointers.md` §9
holds it.

## Audit findings, unactioned

Six investigations ran during wave 1; all reports are in `docs/audits/`, and
`remediation.md` indexes them and records what was decided. The blockers and major
findings were fixed during wave 1.

**Four remain open**, from `docs/audits/false-confidence.md`. Each is small, and each
is best taken by the card that next touches that area — not as a sweep:

| Finding | Whoever next touches |
|---|---|
| The single-writer guard on billing status is defeated by aliasing the import | billing |
| The threshold rule is defeated by naming the constant instead of writing the literal | `packages/rules` |
| Nothing structurally stops product content reaching an analytics event — secrets are redacted, article text is not | analytics, and any card that emits article events |
| The caching argument on the vendor wrappers silently defaults to off, unlike the cost ledger beside it, which is required | `packages/providers` |

Nothing has been acted on beyond recording it here.

## Lanes stopped, and the question that stopped them

None. No lane has started.

## What the next card must know

- **`T2.2`** reads main §14.1 for change detection. §14.1 still contains the
  price-drift row that decision 1 retires — the spec has not been rewritten, by
  convention: `DECISIONS.md` records departures and audits promote them later.
  `T2.2` builds the event emitter, not the refresh policy, so this does not reach
  it; the card that must not build it is `T5.3`, and its card text says so.
- **Anything in M4 or M5** should read `docs/content-pointers.md` before the card,
  as the cards now instruct.
- **The spec is stale in two known places**: §14.1's price-drift row (above), and
  the subscription status list, which enumerates four values where the code has five
  — a fifth was added because storing "card still being authorised" as "gave up"
  corrupted the signup funnel. Both are for the spec keepers, neither blocks a card.
- **Still no vendor credentials.** Stripe, Turnstile, Anthropic and PostHog work is
  built and tested against fakes, and the real-vendor evidence is recorded as
  outstanding rather than claimed. Three cards need re-running against real keys.
- **Email sign-in is unfinished and unowned.** It shipped Google-only because no
  table existed for a magic link's single-use token. That table exists now. No card
  owns finishing it.
